This is the Git repo manifest for Li-Pro.Net Central embedded environment.

toc::[]

== Quick Start

To get the Li-Pro.Net build environment you need to have `repo` installed
and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
$: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lipro-yocto/git-repo/lpn-launcher/repo > ~/.local/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/.local/bin/repo
$: sha1sum ~/.local/bin/repo

For *repo launcher version 2.12.2.2021.2.20*, the SHA-1 checksum
for `repo` is *93cab6406f072e78874dac1d891427c84189f0b6*

For *repo launcher version 2.8.2020.10.4*, the SHA-1 checksum
for `repo` is *1c5afd4164e7b9dd7939334291ededc54ef280f2*

=== Default Manifest

Download default build environment:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/.local/bin
$: mkdir lpn-central-workspace
$: cd lpn-central-workspace
$: repo init -u https://github.com/lipro-yocto/lpn-central-repo \
             -b master -m default.xml
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

=== Build Stage

To start a simple image build:

[source,console]
$: source ./setup-environment
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `lpn-central-workspace/sources`.

==== Yocto Core Images

To see available images, run inside the checked out source path
`lpn-central-workspace/sources`:

[source,console]
$: find . -name core-image*.bb | sort -ub
./poky/meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-base.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal-dev.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal-initramfs.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal-mtdutils.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-tiny-initramfs.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-extended/images/core-image-full-cmdline.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-extended/images/core-image-kernel-dev.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-extended/images/core-image-testmaster.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-extended/images/core-image-testmaster-initramfs.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-graphics/images/core-image-clutter.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-graphics/images/core-image-weston.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-graphics/images/core-image-x11.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-rt/images/core-image-rt.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-rt/images/core-image-rt-sdk.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-sato/images/core-image-sato.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-sato/images/core-image-sato-dev.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-sato/images/core-image-sato-ptest-fast.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-sato/images/core-image-sato-sdk.bb
./poky/meta/recipes-sato/images/core-image-sato-sdk-ptest.bb
./openembedded/meta-xfce/recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal-xfce.bb
./meta-mingw/recipes-core/images/core-image-mingw-sdktest.bb

Those are all available images. And note that, available core images from
*poky* and *meta-openembedded* only. As you may imagine, several other layers
can be included, and any new layer can provide new images.

Yocto Project provides some "pre baked" images. In my point of view, those
images are not to be used on your product. They are examples and quick
starting points.

An handy example: When you desire a pie, you can go to supermarket and buy
a frozen chocolate pie. But when you're developing a pie to be the Apple
Salted Caramel with Dark Chocolate Cinnamon Topping you need to decide every
piece of this pie. What is the base, which type of apple to use. How much
salt on caramel. This is your product, your pie, not a frozen standard pie.

I know the analogy is kind of dumb. But it's important to understand that the
"pre baked" images provided by Yocto Project are not supposed to become a
product image! You can (and maybe should) base your image on some of those
images, but they are not good enough to your product.

I highly recommend you to have your own image file.

.Core Images Overview
[cols="1s,3a,3a",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|===
|Image Name|Formal Description|Use it when/for
3+|core-image-minimal|
  |A small image just capable of allowing a device to boot.
  |* testing machine support
   * boot loader support/upgrade
   * kernel support/upgrade
3+|core-image-minimal-initramfs|
2+|Small image capable of booting a device. The kernel includes the Minimal
   RAM-based Initial Root Filesystem (initramfs), which finds the first 'init'
   program more efficiently.
3+|core-image-minimal-mtdutils|
2+|Small image capable of booting a device with support for the Minimal MTD
   Utilities, which let the user interact with the MTD subsystem in the kernel
   to perform operations on flash devices.
3+|core-image-base|
  |A console-only image that fully supports the target device hardware.
  |* need to add something like ssh/dropbear or evtest or usb utils
   * always configure this on `local.conf` to add the desired package
3+|core-image-full-cmdline|
2+|A console-only image with more full-featured Linux system functionality
   installed.
3+|core-image-lsb|
2+|An image containing packages that are required to conform to the Linux
   Standard Base (LSB) specification.
3+|core-image-rt|
  |A small image just capable of allowing a device to boot plus a real-time
   test suite and tools appropriate for real-time use.
  |* testing real-time support

   The image supports X11 with a Sato theme, Pimlico applications, and contains
   terminal, editor, and file manager.
3+|core-image-minimal-xfce|
2+|A XFCE minimal demo image.
3+|core-image-mingw-sdktest|
2+|A specific image that can be used to build MinGW SDKs. This image includes
   extra recipes that are know to build for MinGW so that they can be tested
   on the autobuilder.
|===

All those images *DO NOT* include `-dev` packages or native build. If you want
it you *MUST* configure your `local.conf`. Although, you can find special images
that provides the header files or the native compiler.

The images with *-dev* sufix include the header files (and development files)
from all packages. For example: *core-image-minimal-dev* (A small image just
capable of allowing a device to boot and is suitable for development work.)

The images with *-sdk* sufix include the native build tools. For example
*core-image-sato-sdk* (Image with Sato support that includes everything within
*core-image-sato* plus *meta-toolchain*, development headers and libraries to
form a standalone SDK.)

When sending patches, please use something like:

[source,console]
$: git send-email --to rexut@users.noreply.github.com <generated patch>

== Using Development and Testing Branches

Replace the `repo init` command above with one of the following:

master:: For developers
+
[source,console]
$: repo init -u https://github.com/lipro-yocto/lpn-central -b master

master-next:: For intrepid developers and testers
+
Patches are typically merged into master-next and then are merged into master
after a testing and comment period. It's possible that master-next has
something you want or need. But it's also possible that using master-next
breaks something that was working before. Use with caution.

[source,console]
$: repo init -u https://github.com/lipro-yocto/lpn-central -b master-next
